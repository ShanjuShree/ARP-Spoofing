# ARP-Spoofing
ARP Spoofing is a serious security concern. Here is how it is performed.
ARP spoofing is often used as a technique in man-in-the-middle (MitM) attacks. In a man-in-the-middle attack, an unauthorized entity intercepts or alters the communication between two parties without their knowledge.
ARP spoofing, also known as ARP poisoning or ARP cache poisoning, is a network attack in which an attacker sends fake Address Resolution Protocol (ARP) messages to an Ethernet LAN.
